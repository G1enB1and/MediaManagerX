# MediaManagerX

**A powerful, modern media manager built for large libraries, AI workflows, and deep metadata.**

MediaManagerX helps you explore, organize, and understand your media — not just store it.  
Browse thousands of files smoothly, navigate by time, and surface hidden metadata like AI prompts, EXIF data, and embedded comments.

## 🔥 Why MediaManagerX?

Most media managers treat files like static objects.

MediaManagerX treats them like **living data**.

- Navigate your library by **collections, time, or folders**
- Extract and edit **deep embedded metadata** (AI prompts, EXIF, workflows)
- Handle **massive collections** without losing performance
- Stay flexible with **database + embedded metadata dual storage**

---

## 🧭 Built For

- 🎨 AI artists (Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, Midjourney workflows)
- 📸 Photographers with large photo archives
- 🎬 Video editors and content creators
- 🧠 Researchers building datasets or tagging systems
- 🗂️ Power users who want control over their files

## ✨ Key Features
