# Change Log

## v1.0.22 (Current)

### Added

- **Bottom AI Panel Shell**: Added a new hideable and resizable bottom panel with persisted visibility and size so the upcoming AI chat area has a dedicated place in the layout.
- **Explorer-Style Address Bar**: Replaced the simple selected-folder label with a full Windows Explorer-style address bar that shows the full path as clickable breadcrumbs.
- **Breadcrumb Folder Menus**: Added dropdown chevrons between breadcrumb segments and at the end of the current path so nearby folders can be opened directly from the address bar.

### Changed

- **Navigation Responsiveness**: Moved breadcrumb folder enumeration, gallery counts, and gallery listing requests off the UI thread so folder navigation is less likely to freeze the app.
- **Tree Sync Scheduling**: Changed native tree synchronization so folder navigation updates the selected folder first and coalesces heavier tree sync work behind a deferred timer instead of doing it immediately on every navigation.
- **Address Bar Interaction**: Added editable-path mode plus keyboard navigation and lazy-expanding flyout menus so the address bar behaves much closer to Windows Explorer.
- **Header Wrapping**: Updated the header layout so pagination drops below the address bar on narrower widths instead of overlapping it.
- **Release Build Safety**: Hardened the release build flow to catch stale packaged artifacts before producing an installer and kept `setup.cfg` versioning in sync during version bumps.

---

## v1.0.21

### Added

- **Explorer-Style Folder Navigation**: Added `Back`, `Up`, `Forward`, and `Refresh` controls beside the selected-folder readout for faster folder browsing.

### Changed

- **Context Menu Placement**: Refined right-click menu positioning so menus stay fully visible on screen instead of getting clipped near the bottom or edges.
- **Native Drag Preview Overhaul**: Replaced the Windows shell drag preview with a native in-app drag stack that keeps original aspect ratios, supports larger previews, and positions the preview/tooltip stack cleanly beside the cursor.
- **Multi-Item Drag Stacks**: Multi-select drags now show overlapping preview thumbnails so stacked drags communicate that multiple files are moving or copying.
- **Left Tree Navigation Behavior**: Restored the file tree so normal folder navigation highlights subfolders without re-rooting the tree unexpectedly.

---

## v1.0.20

### Added

- **Metadata Detail Group Headings**: Added `General`, `Camera`, and `AI` section headings to the single-item metadata details panel so dense metadata is easier to scan.

### Changed

- **Gallery Folder Drag and Drop**: Fixed dragging files from the gallery into folder cards shown inside the gallery, while preserving cancel behavior when dropping back on the same item or gallery background.
- **Timeline Polish Pass**: Added active/visible/dim anchor emphasis, corrected the bottom-of-gallery anchor edge case, made the timeline resize against the visible gallery viewport, improved its final positioning, and cleaned up the rounded shell rendering.
- **Metadata Panel Cleanup**: Removed unwanted Qt label indentation/left rules from metadata labels and headings, kept detail-only group headers out of bulk/empty states, and restyled `Clear Tags From DB` to match the other bulk tag editor actions.
- **Glassmorphism Removal**: Removed the appearance toggle and remaining blur/translucency paths so the header, lightbox, and other surfaces render fully opaque without flicker around animated GIFs and videos.
- **Sidebar Divider Stability**: Refined the native sidebar splitter/divider rendering so borders and resize hover states render crisply instead of appearing too thin or flickering.

### Removed

- **Glassmorphism Setting**: Removed the `Enable glassmorphism` appearance option and its remaining runtime wiring.

---

## v1.0.19

### Added

- **What's New Release Notes**: The `What's New` dialog now shows the polished `ReleaseNotes.md` summary first, followed by the full bundled changelog for users who want the detailed breakdown.
- **Timeline Navigation Arrows**: Added dedicated up/down controls to the timeline rail so dense timelines more clearly communicate that extra dates are available above or below the current viewport.

### Changed

- **Timeline Navigation Overhaul**: Rebuilt the grouped-date timeline to use one anchor per real date header, unified tooltip behavior, smoother drag and wheel scrubbing, a hybrid viewported anchor rail for dense timelines, and granularity-specific sizing for day, month, and year modes.
- **Infinite Scroll Policy**: Switched grouped-date non-masonry views plus `List`, `Details`, `Content`, `Small Grid`, and `Medium Grid` to infinite scroll so timeline navigation and long-form browsing are no longer broken up by pagination.
- **Header Responsiveness**: Moved the panel toggle and settings buttons beside Search and reworked the header layout so the controls wrap more cleanly on narrower widths instead of clipping off the right edge.
- **Bundled Help Content**: Packaged `SEARCH_SYNTAX.md` and `ReleaseNotes.md` with installed builds so help/release dialogs work outside the raw development environment.
- **Startup Folder Settings**: Corrected startup-folder settings state so the Browse button and related controls stay enabled/disabled based on the real `restore_last` setting.

---

## v1.0.18

### Changed

- **Details Header Layout**: Refined regular and grouped Details header spacing, sticky positioning, separator styling, and scroll-state behavior so both modes align cleanly without visible jumps or header gaps.
- **Grouped Details Columns**: Fixed grouped-by-date Details mode so the shared resizable header stays aligned with filenames, folders, sizes, and other row data below it while resizing.
- **Sidebar Width Persistence**: Corrected sidebar state persistence so reopening panels restores their previous usable widths instead of saving and restoring zero-width sidebars.
- **WebEngine Startup Stability**: Deferred the initial WebEngine background-color setup until after the event loop starts, avoiding native startup aborts seen on some installed Windows machines.

---

## v1.0.17

### Added

- **Crash Diagnostics**: Added local crash-report generation, `faulthandler` logging, and Help menu actions to create a diagnostic report or open the crash-report folder for troubleshooting installed builds on other machines.

### Changed

- **Packaged Runtime Stability**: Hardened packaged startup/runtime behavior by normalizing AI metadata values before JSON persistence, preventing scan-time failures from non-serializable EXIF values like Pillow `IFDRational`.
- **Details Panel States**: Updated the right sidebar so it shows a true empty-state prompt when nothing is selected and switches to a dedicated bulk tag editor when multiple files are selected.
- **Bulk Tag Editing**: Refined bulk tag save/embed behavior so entered tags append to existing DB and embedded file tags instead of replacing them.

---

## v1.0.16

### Changed

- **Grouped Details View**: Fixed grouped Details mode so only one sticky column header appears at the top, date groups collapse correctly, sticky date headers sit beneath the Details header, and the header seam no longer exposes scrolling content behind it.
- **List Context Menu**: Refined list-view context menu layering so the custom right-click menu reliably appears above gallery rows instead of being visually overlapped by list items.
- **Fresh Install Bootstrap**: Updated the packaged database initialization flow to bundle and load the SQL schema correctly in installed builds, preventing first-run launch failures caused by missing `app\\mediamanager\\db` resources.

---

## v1.0.15

### Added

- **Date Grouping**: Added `Group By Date` across gallery views with date headers, collapsible sections, and a right-side jump/scrub timeline.
- **Date Metadata Fields**: Added `Date Taken`, `Date Acquired`, `Date Created`, and `Date Modified` to metadata settings and the Details sidebar for images, GIFs, and videos.

### Changed

- **Timeline UI**: Refined the timeline scrubber layout, spacing, padding, coloring, and docked sizing so it no longer overlaps the gallery and behaves predictably while resizing.
- **Metadata Dates**: Updated scanning, import, save, and embed flows to extract and persist filesystem dates plus EXIF/XMP-style taken/acquired dates, and made `Date Taken` and `Date Acquired` editable in the sidebar.
- **Date Labels**: Renamed date labels throughout the app for consistency with Windows Properties and the Details/settings panels.

---

## v1.0.14

### Changed

- **Installer Build**: Updated the packaged Windows app so background media scanning and related `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` work no longer opens console windows while scanning folders.

---

## v1.0.13

### Added in v1.0.13

- **AVIF Support**: Introduced support for AVIF image files.
- **New Gallery Views**: Added several new view modes including List, Details, Content, and multiple Grid sizes (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large) alongside the default Masonry layout.

- **Details Panel Responsiveness**: Improved the responsiveness of the metadata details panel.
- **Hidden Files Logic**: Updated hidden files, folders, and collections logic to use hidden status in database rather than filenames starting with a dot.

### Fixed in v1.0.13

- **File Tree**: Fixed a critical issue where the folder tree appeared empty in the installed application when the root was a drive path (e.g., `C:/Pictures`).
- **AVIF Previews**: Implemented FFmpeg-based fallback for AVIF sidebar previews, resolving the issue where native Qt support was missing.
- **AVIF Dimensions**: Added ffprobe-based dimension retrieval for AVIF files to ensure correct aspect ratios and details rendering.

---

## v1.0.7

### Changed in v1.0.7

- **Video Player Sizing Fix**: Addressed a race condition that caused in-place gallery videos to occasionally play at an incorrect, minimized size.
- **Lightbox Styling Refinements**: Fixed an issue where hovering over the lightbox previous/next navigation buttons caused them to shift downward. They now scale up smoothly in place.
- **Mute Default Restored**: Fixed a bug where in-place videos would sometimes start with sound. Videos are properly muted by default again.
- **Previous and Next Buttons Changed**: Replaced the native video player's previous and next emoji buttons with custom SVG graphics to prevent the Windows OS from rendering them with colorful backgrounds.

### Removed in v1.0.7

- **Close Buttons Removed**: Completely removed both the native video player close button and the underlying web lightbox close button to eliminate visual ghosting and overlapping. Users can cleanly close the media overview by clicking anywhere outside the media content.

---

## v1.0.6

### Added in v1.0.6

- **In-Place Video Playback**: Videos can now play directly inside the gallery card, overlaid on the thumbnail, without opening a separate window.
- **Custom SVG Media Controls**: Play and Pause buttons now use custom SVG icons for a crisp, professional appearance that avoids OS emoji rendering issues on Windows.
- **Video Controls Overlay**: A translucent control bar with play/pause, mute, volume slider, and a seek bar is displayed while a video is playing in-place.

### Changed in v1.0.6

- **Accent Color on Video Sliders**: Volume and seek bar sliders in the video overlay now use the user's selected accent color from Settings.
- **Smart Lazy Loading**: Gallery images are now loaded on demand as you scroll, using a native `IntersectionObserver` bound to the scrollable container. Images one full screen below the visible area are preloaded before you scroll to them.
- **Poster Restoration**: Pausing or closing an in-place video now correctly restores the original thumbnail poster image.
- **Video Click Behavior**: Clicking the video frame no longer pauses playback; only the dedicated Pause button does.
- **Fixed What's New:** What's New now accurately reflects current Changelog.md.
- **Fixed Auto-Update:** Auto-Update now uses RedirectPolicyAttribute with NoLessSafeRedirectPolicy which properly follows the redirects that github uses for releases.

### Removed in v1.0.6

- **Removed Loading Media Dialog**: Removed the "Loading Media" progress dialogue because local files load faster than the dialog can meaningfully update, eliminating a visual stutter on every gallery update.

---

## v1.0.5

### Changed in v1.0.5

- **File Tree Fix**: Improved path normalization and initialization robustness to ensure the file tree is visible in the packaged installer environment.
- **Improved Logging**: Added detailed initialization logging to help diagnose environment-specific path issues.

### Changed in v1.0.4

- **Cursor Feedback**: Cursor now changes to a hand pointer when hovering over clickable folders and files.
- **Conflict Dialog Improvements**:
  - Fixed SVG rendering for the **“Apply to all”** checkbox so the checkmark displays correctly in all themes.
  - Improved button hover effects for clearer interaction feedback.
  - Fixed vertical clipping of long filenames.
- **Drag & Drop Refinements**:
  - Improved handling of multi-file transfers between the gallery and file tree.
